# Roadmap

Open plans only — intent before implementation, expected to change as
reality pushes back. The commit that adds a plan's `DECISIONS.md` entry
deletes it from here; for plans already built, see DECISIONS.md's
2026-09-11 "Retired ROADMAP entries" entry. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-08-18 — Other camera/recording settings surveyed, not acted on (yet)

Surfaced alongside the UVC autofocus/auto-exposure lock (see DECISIONS.md);
recorded so it isn't re-derived later, not committed work.

- **Recording quality (`codec`/`crf`/`preset`)** is hardcoded in
  `Recorder`'s defaults (`libx264`, `crf=23`), never wired to
  `config.json` — the category `fps` was in before it moved, and a real
  quality-vs-disk tradeoff that could differ by an institution's storage
  budget. Move it to the `recording` section if a real need shows up.
- **`MAX_SESSION_MINUTES`, `DEFAULT_STALL_TIMEOUT_S`,
  `REQUIRED_SPACE_MULTIPLIER`** (`kiosk.py`) are constructor parameters
  with measured defaults, deliberately not config: nobody has needed a
  different value, and config for a hypothetical isn't earned.

## 2026-08-26 — Health-check tool surveyed, not acted on (yet)

A technician-facing "Doctor": one glanceable green/yellow/red report
consolidating diagnostics that exist but are scattered and reactive — the
SDK version check buried in `packaging/reflex.iss` (install-time only),
`config.py`'s validation (only when `app.exe` launches), `settings.py`'s
"not connected" detection (only if a technician opens it), `kiosk.py`'s
disk preflight (only just before Start).

**Shelved** — possibly overboard at this scale; revisit if
diagnostic-hunting becomes a real recurring problem, not preemptively. If
built it stays diagnosis-only (no silent auto-fix), per CLAUDE.md's "loud
and early" — the one plausible exception being a technician-clicked
"re-run the IDS peak install", which only re-exposes what
`InstallIdsPeakSilently()` already does once, safely.

## 2026-09-11 — Optional student identifier on a recording (planned, not designed)

From the first round of student feedback: an optional name or nickname for
the student doctor, so recordings can be tracked to whoever made them,
with a nickname allowed out of respect for FERPA. The open questions are
in DECISIONS.md's "First round of student feedback" entry (item E). The
main ones: whether the identifier goes into folder names or only into
`session.json`, and NECO's answer on real names and on who can see whose
recordings. Those need answers before any design. Whatever it becomes, it
must stay optional and must never gate Start.

## 2026-09-12 — Use what each camera's stack actually offers (planned, not built)

Replaces the separate "legacy BIO picture registers" and "shadow detail on
the slit lamp" entries: they were the same question asked of two devices.
`IMAGING.md` lists what each stack exposes; this closes the distance between
that and what Reflex writes. Order is by cost, and three of the four
candidates cost nothing at all.

**Rules for the whole program.** Every step is a measurement before it is a
change, and each lands separately so a regression has one suspect. Anything
that turns out to be a per-model fact becomes a `DeviceProfile` field, not a
technician knob — CLAUDE.md's ownership table — and `config.json` gains an
override only where the answer is genuinely per-room. Nothing here may gate
Start: every one of these is visible in the live preview, and the
technician's test recording is the backstop.

### Phase 0 — probe, because five of these are guesses

Run `tools/probe_camera_features.py` against both IDS cameras. It has never
executed, so expect to fix it first. It answers region of interest and
binning (a bigger bandwidth lever than any format change, and possibly
enough to make higher bit depth free), `DeviceLinkThroughputLimit`,
hardware `ReverseX`/`ReverseY` (which would make the per-frame rotation
Reflex does today free), and whether `Gamma` survives `TLParamsLocked`.
Fold the answers into `IMAGING.md`; that file's "Not yet known" section is
the definition of done.

### Phase 1 — the free writes, one at a time

Each is a value the hardware already has and Reflex has never written.
Measure the frame before and after (median, clipped fraction, p99.9) and
keep the numbers in the DECISIONS entry.

- **Slit lamp black level.** The only one actively destroying data: at the
  camera's default of 90, 30% of every frame is pinned to exactly 0. Find
  the value that clips nothing without lifting the beam's black surround
  into grey, then make it a profile field applied in `_open()` — after the
  pixel clock, before `TLParamsLocked`.
- **Digital BIO gamma, then its lookup table.** The camera can apply the
  tone curve that would rescue its shadows, on board, for no bandwidth and
  no host CPU. Gamma first because it is one number; the LUT only if one
  exponent proves too blunt.
- **Legacy BIO picture registers.** Confirm what each of `R20`-`R25` does
  before changing any: we inherit five values from a vendor capture and
  have checked none. Then own them in a profile rather than replaying
  constants. While the camera is attached, also re-derive the START/STOP
  split — those four writes are picture registers and cannot stop a bridge,
  so something else did.
- **Hands camera exposure.** Today the two-second warmup's result is frozen,
  so every session starts from whatever the room looked like. Have
  `settings.py` record the converged value at calibration time and
  `uvc_camera` apply it at every start — a per-room value, so `config.json`
  is its right home.

### Phase 2 — only if Phase 1 is not enough

Higher bit depth plus a tone curve, and only for a camera that cannot curve
for itself, which today means the slit lamp alone. `ids_peak_ipl` supplies
`GammaCorrector` (with `SetDigitalBlack`), so the pieces are vendor code
rather than hand-rolled maths. Costs roughly 2x the USB bandwidth and
per-frame CPU, both of which need measuring on the clinic machine, not this
laptop. If Phase 1 recovers the shadows, write that down and stop here.

**Stop conditions worth stating up front:** a measurement that shows no
improvement ends that step, and the DECISIONS entry records the numbers
that killed it. Inheriting the vendor's value is a legitimate outcome for
the legacy BIO. "We could set it" was never the argument; "the picture is
better and we can show it" is.
