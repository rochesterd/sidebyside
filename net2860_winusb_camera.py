"""BaseCamera for the older Vantage Plus BIO's camera over WinUSB.

Replaces net2860_camera.py's route to the same hardware. That one drives
Keeler's vendor driver through a 32-bit COM filter in a helper subprocess;
this one talks to the eMPIA EM2860 bridge directly through Microsoft's
inbox winusb.sys, in-process, with nothing of Keeler's or NET GmbH's
involved. See DECISIONS.md's 2026-09-09 WinUSB entries for why -- briefly:
the vendor driver is unobtainable, not on Windows Update, and loads only
through legacy signing allowances that Microsoft can withdraw.

What the host actually has to do is small, because the camera images
itself: a Sony CXD3172AR CCD signal processor does the CCD timing, the
A/D, the colour processing and the AE/AWB detection, with a Silicon Labs
C8051F321 closing the loop, and it feeds ITU-R BT.656 straight into the
bridge. There is no analog decoder and no sensor to configure. A USB
capture of the vendor driver confirmed this on the wire: 62 register
writes, zero I2C transactions, in Linux em28xx's documented protocol.

Consequences worth knowing:

- No exposure/gain/white-balance control, unlike IdsCamera. That is not a
  gap here -- the AE/AWB loop lives in C8051F321 firmware the host cannot
  address, so no driver for this camera can offer it.
- Frame.index comes from the *hardware*: each field header carries a
  counter that wraps at 128, unwrapped here into a monotonic frame number.
  Unlike UvcCamera and net2860_camera.py -- both of which self-count and
  therefore look drop-free by construction -- gaps in this index are real
  source-side drops, which is exactly what camera.py's _grab() contract
  asks for and what recorder.py's drop accounting needs.

Video arrives as isochronous transfers only (there is no bulk endpoint).
Each packet carries a 4-byte header: "22 5a <seq> 88" starts a field,
"88 88 88 88" continues one. A field is 720x288 YUYV; two interleave into
one 720x576 frame at 25fps.
