"""Renders a recorded session's two streams into one shareable MP4, in
whichever layout was asked for.

This is the old live composite, produced on demand instead of on every
recording -- see ROADMAP.md's "Recorder/Viewer split: design" entry. It
reads only; the streams it composites are never modified, and the output
is written to a temporary file and moved into place, so a cancelled or
failed export can't leave something that looks like a finished one.

No Qt import: viewer.py runs this on a worker thread and reports progress
through the callbacks below.
