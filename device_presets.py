"""Per-model camera facts that can't be read from the device itself and
don't vary between installs -- so the program just knows them, rather than
a technician having to discover and configure them.

A `DeviceProfile` is one supported instrument camera: how to recognise it,
what to call it, and the corrections it needs. `PROFILES` is the whole
supported list, and `SUPPORTED_HARDWARE.md` is its prose counterpart -- add
to both together.

Two ways in, for two different questions:

  profiles_for_role()/profile_for_id()  what settings.py offers a
                                        technician, and what a saved
                                        `config.json` profile id resolves to
  orientation_for_model()/              what IdsCamera._open() applies when
  pixel_clock_hz_for_model()            nothing in config.json says otherwise

Both read the same table, so a preset and the profile a technician picked
cannot disagree. A `config.json` `orientation`/`pixel_clock_hz` value still
overrides either (see config.py / app.py), as the escape hatch for a
non-standard mounting or a host that can't take the full clock.

CUSTOM_PROFILE_ID is deliberately not in PROFILES: "custom" means the
technician supplies what a profile would have, so an unlisted but working
camera is never locked out and a new instrument never waits on a code
change. A config.json written before profiles existed -- a typed label and
no profile id -- *is* a custom entry, which is why that shape stays valid.

Lightweight on purpose -- only imports camera.py (stdlib + numpy) for the
orientation constants, no Qt / IDS SDK, so it stays importable anywhere
ids_camera.py is. See DECISIONS.md's "Device-model rotation presets" entry
and its orientation-correction follow-up.
