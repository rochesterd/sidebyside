; Inno Setup script for the Reflex clinic-machine installer -- see
; PACKAGING.md for the full build procedure and ROADMAP.md's "Distribute
; a frozen-exe installer" entry for why this exists instead of shipping
; Python source + setup.ps1 to clinic machines.
;
; Expects three things to already exist before compiling (see PACKAGING.md):
;   1. packaging\dist\app\ and packaging\dist\settings\ -- built via
;      `pyinstaller packaging\app.spec` / `pyinstaller packaging\settings.spec`.
;   2. vendor\ids-peak-win-extended-setup-64.exe -- the current IDS peak
;      *extended* setup installer (not standard/runtime -- see
;      ROADMAP.md's "why extended, not IDS Software Suite + runtime
;      setup" reasoning), manually placed there by whoever's building
;      this. Gitignored, same convention this repo already uses for
;      vendor/ids_peak_api.txt. Always use this exact filename regardless
;      of the IDS SDK version currently bundled, so this script never
;      needs editing just because IDS shipped a new version.
;   3. vendor\ids-peak-response.iss -- an InstallShield silent-install
;      response file recorded from a real Custom install of the *same*
;      vendor\ids-peak-win-extended-setup-64.exe currently in vendor\,
;      with the uEye Transport Layer component enabled. Recorded via
;      `ids-peak-win-extended-setup-64.exe /r /f1"<output path>"` on a
;      machine with no prior IDS peak install (a fresh Windows Sandbox
;      session is the easiest way to guarantee that) -- see PACKAGING.md
;      for the exact recording steps. Must be re-recorded, against that
;      new installer, every time vendor\ids-peak-win-extended-setup-64.exe
;      is bumped to a new IDS release -- see DECISIONS.md's "Silent IDS
;      peak install" entry for why a stale response file is the real risk
;      here, and how IdsPeakAlreadyInstalled()'s post-install re-check
;      guards against it silently going unnoticed if that step is missed.

#define AppVersion "1.0"
; ids_peak.dll's own FileVersion, as actually installed by
; vendor/ids-peak-win-extended-setup-64.exe (currently packaging IDS peak
; 26.06.1) -- confirmed empirically on the build machine via
; (Get-Item '...\ids_peak\program\ids_peak.dll').VersionInfo.FileVersion,
; not assumed. IDS's installer-package version string (e.g. "26.06.1")
; and this DLL's own FileVersion are unrelated numbering schemes -- see
; DECISIONS.md's "IdsPeakAlreadyInstalled() checks a version, not just a
; folder" entry for why this specific file+field is what gets compared,
; and why a bare folder-existence check isn't enough. Update this
; whenever vendor/ids-peak-win-extended-setup-64.exe is bumped to a new
; IDS release, by checking that release's own ids_peak.dll the same way.

   Kinexis/Vantage Plus Digital installer) ships exactly this mechanism
   in production, and the two failure modes it risks are both guarded
   against below rather than trusted blindly the way Kinexis's own
   install script does (it doesn't check its own exit code or log at
   all):
     1. A hard failure (Windows blocks it, install crashes) -- caught via
        Exec's own ResultCode and the /f2 log file's ResultCode line.
     2. A "successful" replay that silently picked the wrong components,
        because vendor\ids-peak-win-extended-setup-64.exe moved on to a
        version whose dialog layout no longer matches
        vendor\ids-peak-response.iss -- Exec/the log can't see this at

   protected Reflex's own install from an indefinite hang in this

   choice working as Inno's real native Finished-page mechanism instead
   of a separate popup -- a deliberate call, not an oversight, made after

   WHY A CERTIFICATE HAS TO BE TRUSTED AT ALL: the package contains no
   binaries -- every install section is an Include/Needs into the inbox
   winusb.inf, so the only kernel driver involved is Microsoft's own
   already-signed winusb.sys. That means Kernel Mode Code Signing (the
   gate needing an EV certificate and a Partner Center submission) never
   applies, and what remains is ordinary PnP *package* signing, which a
   self-signed certificate satisfies. Adding it to Root and
   TrustedPublisher is a narrow grant -- "trust driver packages from this
   publisher" -- and specifically NOT machine-wide test-signing, which
   DECISIONS.md rejected for a different driver on exactly this axis.

   NOT FATAL ON FAILURE, deliberately: this camera is optional hardware.
   A clinic with only IDS instruments must not have its install aborted
   because an optional driver step failed. But it is reported rather than
   swallowed -- a silently missing driver would surface much later as a
   camera that simply never appears in settings.py's dropdown.

   Staged even when no such camera is attached. pnputil staging is
   harmless without the device -- the package just sits in the driver
   store and binds if one is ever plugged in -- and that is what makes
   the camera plug-and-play afterwards rather than needing a second

     - Recordings, wherever sessions_dir points. CLAUDE.md is explicit that
       these are irreplaceable student work, not build output. An uninstall
       must never take them.
     - config.json. Cheap to keep, and it holds a technician's camera
       assignments and calibration -- a reinstall that finds them intact is
       strictly better than one that does not.
     - The IDS peak SDK. Shared: other software (Keeler's own Kinexis) uses
       the same install, so removing it could break an unrelated
       application. It also has its own uninstaller.

   WHAT IT DOES REMOVE, because this installer added them and nothing else
   uses them: the WinUSB driver package it staged, and the certificate it
   trusted. Leaving a self-signed root certificate behind after the
   software that justified it is gone would quietly undercut the whole
   argument for self-signing -- that it is a narrow, revocable grant. A
