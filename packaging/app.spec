# PyInstaller spec for app.py, the kiosk entry point -- see PACKAGING.md
# for how this fits into the full installer build, and ROADMAP.md's
# "Distribute a frozen-exe installer" entry for why this exists at all.
#
# Empty hiddenimports/binaries/datas below aren't a placeholder -- this
# spec is the result of an actual empirical build: PySide6, cv2 (OpenCV),
# av (PyAV), and comtypes (via pygrabber, used by uvc_enumeration.py) all
# had working PyInstaller hooks already, and ids_peak/ids_peak_ipl's
# native DLLs were picked up automatically by PyInstaller's own binary
# dependency scan (no vendor-specific hook needed). Confirmed by actually
# running the frozen app.exe --synthetic (all-synthetic path) and
# --third-person-synthetic (forces the real `from ids_camera import
# IdsCamera` import at startup) -- both ran cleanly with no import or
# DLL-load errors. If a future IDS peak SDK version bump breaks this,
# that's the first place to look.
#
# upx=False, deliberately, on both EXE and COLLECT below: UPX-compressed
# executables are a known source of false-positive antivirus flags,
# which is a real risk on a locked-down clinic machine and not worth the
# smaller file size.
