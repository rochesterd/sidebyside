# PyInstaller spec for viewer.py -- see PACKAGING.md and app.spec's comment
# for the shared reasoning (same empirically-confirmed dependency set for
# PySide6/cv2/av, same upx=False antivirus rationale).
#
# This is the *only* spec built for the viewer-only installer
# (packaging/sidebyside-viewer.iss), which ships to machines with no
# cameras, no IDS peak SDK and usually no admin rights -- see ROADMAP.md's
# "Phase 4: two installers" entry.
#
# The clinic installer deliberately does NOT ship this exe: app.exe already
# contains the viewer (app.py imports viewer.py, so Watch and Past
# recordings work from inside the kiosk), and bundling a second full
# PySide6+cv2+av tree would add hundreds of MB to an installer that's
# already ~490MB for no capability the clinic machine lacks.
#
# `excludes` below is an assertion, not a size optimisation. viewer.py's
# import graph -- viewer -> session_reader/session_export -> recorder
# (constants only via session_format) -> av, camera -> plus compositor,
# qt_image, config -- reaches nothing camera-facing. Naming those modules
# here means that stops being something to re-check by eye: if a future
# edit makes the viewer import ids_camera or uvc_enumeration, this build
# fails loudly instead of silently gaining a 300MB SDK dependency the
# review machine can't satisfy.
#
# winusb/net2860_winusb_camera are listed for the same reason rather than
# for size -- they are small, pure-Python and would cost nothing to ship.
# The point is that the viewer reaching them would mean the review build
# had grown a camera dependency, and a review machine has no cameras and
# no driver package installed.

# The icon is listed twice on purpose: `icon=` writes the exe resource
# (Explorer, taskbar, shortcuts), `datas` ships the file itself for
# QApplication.setWindowIcon(), which can't read that resource back.
