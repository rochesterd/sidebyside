"""IDS peak GenICam camera implementation of BaseCamera.

One class covers both real cameras (Haag-Streit slit lamp UI-3250CP-C-HQ,
via the uEye Transport Layer, and Keeler U3-327xCP-C, native USB3 Vision).

The stack, simply: a GenICam camera publishes its own feature list (a "node
map"), IDS peak finds cameras and moves buffers, and a *transport layer*
per camera family puts each camera on that one DeviceManager list -- and
decides which features reach us at all. Both are therefore ordinary GenICam
devices here, differing only by the serial passed in (SETUP.md Section 3
installs the uEye layer) -- but not by feature set: the uEye layer
publishes no ExposureAuto/GainAuto/BalanceWhiteAuto, which is why every
optional node below goes through TryFindNode() and why the slit lamp
depends on auto_calibrate() rather than anything on the camera.

What this module uses, in order: Library.Initialize(); DeviceManager to
find the serial; OpenDevice(Control) to claim it; the RemoteDevice node map
for every setting; one DataStream fed with buffers we allocate and queue;
then WaitForFinishedBuffer() -> Buffer (FrameID plus pixels), which
ids_peak_ipl converts from Bayer to BGR8. _open()'s comments say why its
order is what it is; the order is load-bearing.

See CLAUDE.md's Architecture section: nothing outside this module may
import ids_peak/ids_peak_ipl.

Cameras are native Bayer sensors; frames are converted to BGR8 here so
every consumer downstream of BaseCamera (compositor, recorder, preview)
keeps working against Frame.image unmodified. Source pixel format is read
from each captured buffer rather than assumed, since the two camera
models may use different Bayer patterns.

Frame.index is each buffer's own Buffer.FrameID(), not a locally-assigned
counter -- required by BaseCamera._grab's contract so a consumer draining
frames via read() can detect real gaps (including ones the device itself
introduced) rather than a renumbering that's gapless by construction. See
DECISIONS.md's "Frame.index was never actually gap-detectable" entry.

Hardware-verified against both real cameras via tools/smoke_test_camera.py
as of 2026-08-12 -- Keeler (U3-327xCP-C, serial 4110050487) and slit lamp
(UI325xCP-C, uEye Transport Layer, serial 4103484089). See DECISIONS.md's
two "Hardware smoke test" entries for what each surfaced and fixed. Known
platform difference between them, both handled: the uEye Transport Layer
doesn't implement DataStream.PayloadSize() (_payload_size() falls back to
the NodeMap) and has no ExposureAuto/GainAuto (_converge_auto_nodes()
skips both gracefully) -- the slit lamp camera needs a one-time
exposure/gain calibration once mounted on the instrument. That calibration
is done in-app now (supports_manual_calibration()/auto_calibrate()/the
manual get_/set_exposure_time_us()/get_/set_gain() pair below, driven by
settings.py's PreviewDialog), not via an external tool like IDS peak
Cockpit -- see DECISIONS.md's 2026-08-25 calibration entry.
Since 2026-09-10 that calibration is offered for *any* camera whose
ExposureTime/Gain a technician can write, not only one with no
ExposureAuto/GainAuto -- see supports_manual_calibration() for why the
Keeler's converge-at-open turned out to be the wrong thing to rely on.

White balance (needs_manual_white_balance()/auto_white_balance()/the manual
get_/set_red_balance_ratio()/get_/set_blue_balance_ratio() pair) and the
acquisition frame-rate cap (_apply_frame_rate_cap()) follow the same
in-app-not-external-tool philosophy, added per DECISIONS.md's 2026-08-26
entry. `_converge_auto_nodes()` generalizes what used to be a single
exposure/gain-specific convergence loop (`_converge_auto_exposure()`) to
also cover `BalanceWhiteAuto`, since all three follow the identical
Once-then-poll-until-Off-then-lock shape.

Hardware-verified against both real cameras again on 2026-09-08, which
closed most of the "unverified" notes this module used to carry:
`_converge_auto_nodes()`, `exposure_time_range_us()`/`gain_range()`'s
Minimum()/Maximum() accessors, `_apply_frame_rate_cap()`,
`auto_calibrate()`, and the two additions below -- `_apply_pixel_clock()`
and `_apply_auto_exposure_limit()`. Both cameras now deliver the
configured 30fps with no dropped frames; see DECISIONS.md's 2026-09-08
entries for what that took.

Still unverified, and unreachable on the present hardware: the manual
white-balance path (`auto_white_balance()` and the BalanceRatioSelector/
BalanceRatio accessors). `needs_manual_white_balance()` returns False on
both cameras -- the Keeler has working BalanceWhiteAuto and the slit lamp
exposes no white-balance nodes at all -- so nothing here can exercise it.
It needs a camera with no BalanceWhiteAuto *but* with BalanceRatio, which
neither of these is. Flagged again at its call site below.

        This deliberately asks a *different* question than it used to.
        The old one (needs_manual_calibration(): "does this camera lack
        ExposureAuto/GainAuto?") answered False for the Keeler, on the
        reasoning that a camera which converges on its own has nothing for
        a technician to calibrate. That reasoning was wrong about *when*
        it converges. _converge_auto_nodes() runs inside _open(), which
        kiosk.select_instrument() calls the instant a student taps the
        instrument on the picker -- with the BIO still on the desk, its
        illumination off, pointed at nothing. `Once` then leaves that
        result locked for the whole session, and the camera is never
        reopened, so switching the lamp on afterwards changes nothing.
        There is no pre-recording moment when the scene is representative
        (students press Start *before* raising the instrument to the eye),
        which is what makes a technician-calibrated config value the only
        answer that is right at record time. See DECISIONS.md's
        2026-09-10 entry.

        Device-side auto-convergence remains the fallback: _open() drops
        an axis from _converge_auto_nodes() only when config.json actually
        supplied a value for it, so an uncalibrated install behaves
        exactly as before.
