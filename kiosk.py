# libx264 at crf=23 (Recorder's default) targets quality, not a fixed
# bitrate, but ~0.08 bits/pixel/frame is a standard rule of thumb for
# moderate-motion content at that quality. At a 2560x1080 canvas and 30fps
# (the fallback estimate used before real camera resolutions are known --
# see _estimated_canvas() below):
#
#   bits/sec  = 0.08 * (2560 * 1080) * 30        ~= 6.64 Mbps

# the estimate is unchanged: sum-of-widths x max-height is still the right
# proxy for total pixels/sec across both streams, whether they're stacked
# into one canvas or written separately.
#
# During finalization each stream briefly has both its .mkv (the
# interruption-safe capture copy) and its freshly-remuxed .mp4 on disk at

# session needs is about two copies of that estimate, even though a
