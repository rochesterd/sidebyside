"""Pure math behind IdsCamera.auto_calibrate() --
brightness measurement and the exposure/gain correction steps -- split
out from ids_camera.py so it's
unit-testable without the IDS peak SDK (this dev machine has no ids_peak
installed; see CLAUDE.md's Environment section).

See DECISIONS.md's 2026-08-25 calibration entry, and its 2026-09-11
"Retired ROADMAP entries" entry for the calibration UX, for the design: a
one-shot software auto-exposure for cameras with no ExposureAuto/GainAuto
(the slit lamp camera). Raises ExposureTime before Gain when more
brightness is needed -- Gain amplifies sensor noise, ExposureTime doesn't,
and this footage gets reviewed by students studying their own technique.

See DECISIONS.md's 2026-08-26 entry for center_crop() (vignette/center-
weighted metering), added for the same reason as the exposure/gain
algorithm above: no ExposureAuto/GainAuto on the slit lamp means no
device-side auto-convergence to fall back on.
