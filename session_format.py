"""The on-disk vocabulary of a recorded session, shared by the writer
(recorder.py) and the readers (session_reader.py, session_export.py).

Its own module so the reader doesn't have to import the writer for three
constants -- which read oddly, and drags the whole encoder path into the
viewer-only build (see ROADMAP.md's "Phase 4: two installers" entry).
Pure stdlib, no imports at all.

A session directory holds:

    <YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>/
      instrument.mp4      # native resolution, variable frame rate
      third_person.mp4    # native resolution, variable frame rate
      session.json        # the manifest below
      [<role>.mkv]        # only if that stream's MP4 failed verification

Filenames are fixed by *role*, not by which instrument was in use, so a
reader never has to consult the manifest to find the files. Which
instrument it was, and its display label, live in session.json.

Every frame's PTS in every stream is `grab time - clock.origin_monotonic`
on a 1/1000 time base, so equal PTS in two files means the two frames
were captured at the same instant. That is the whole synchronization
story -- see ROADMAP.md/DECISIONS.md's "Recorder/Viewer split" entries.
