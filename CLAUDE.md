Standing context for this project. Read this before making changes.

## What this is

Reflex records two cameras simultaneously so optometry students at NECO
can watch themselves from a third-person view alongside the view through
the instrument they're using, played back together.

The purpose is self-directed practice for the NBEO CSE (Clinical Skills
Examination). Students book time, record themselves practising a skill on a
peer, and watch it back. The coordination between what their hands are doing
and what appears through the optics is the entire point of the recording.

## Who uses it

Students, unsupervised, with no technical background and no instructor
present. They will not read documentation, will not open a terminal, and
will not debug anything.

Design consequences:

- Intuitive to Apple's standard, not just "usable." A tech handles
  installation, configuration, and calibration; within a session, the
  student is guided entirely by the app, never by documentation.
- Protecting the student from mistakes is the goal, not minimizing what's
  clickable for its own sake. During recording that protection is
  absolute: nothing but Stop is interactive, since interrupting an
  irreplaceable, in-progress capture is unrecoverable.
- Before recording, the same goal applies with less rigidity. Today it's
  satisfied by a minimal instrument picker + Start (see `app.py`) — not
  because fewer buttons is inherently better. A more guided flow is fine
  there, provided nothing in it can bypass the readiness gates below or
  misconfigure a session.
- Failures must be **loud and early**. A black pane discovered a week later
  is the worst outcome. Prefer refusing to start over recording something
  broken.
- The start button stays disabled until the selected instrument camera and
  the third-person camera are both confirmed live, and there is enough disk
  space. No instrument selected counts as not ready — Start stays disabled
  and the status line prompts for a selection, the same way it prompts for
  a missing camera. Readiness gates cover what a student *can't* see — a
  camera that isn't running, a frozen picture, a full disk. A visibly wrong
  picture is not a gate: the live preview already shows it, and stranding
  an unsupervised student with a disabled Start is its own failure. See
  DECISIONS.md's 2026-09-10 entry.
- Never make the irreplaceable data depend on a step that can fail. Frames
  get written as they arrive; anything derived comes afterward.

## Hardware

The software is built around these components; `SUPPORTED_HARDWARE.md`
covers tested alternatives, what should work, and what's excluded.

| Instrument | Camera | Interface | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Haag-Streit BI 900 slit lamp | IDS UI-3250CP-C-HQ Rev. 2 | USB 3.0 | 1600x1200, legacy uEye family — needs the uEye Transport Layer. Its pixel clock resets to 24 MHz on every open (an ~87 ms frame period); `device_presets.py` sets 80 MHz → 30 fps and applies `rotate_180`. |
| Keeler Vantage Plus Digital | IDS U3-327xCP-C | USB 3.0 | 2056x1542, USB3 Vision, native to IDS peak. `device_presets.py` applies `flip_vertical`. The *older* BIO needs **no** correction (`net2860_winusb_camera.py`) — don't assume the two BIOs share a transform. |
| Third-person (student's hands) | ELP-USB100W03M-L21 | USB 2.0, UVC | Plain UVC webcam; resolution queried at runtime. Identified by VID/PID via `settings.py`, with a single-device fallback (DECISIONS.md). Any UVC-compliant webcam should work. |

The instrument cameras are machine vision cameras, not webcams — no RTSP,
ONVIF or DirectShow; raw frames through the IDS peak SDK on a host PC. The
third-person webcam goes through `cv2.VideoCapture` (`uvc_camera.py`).

**Bandwidth:** only one instrument camera streams at a time, so the load is
one instrument plus the webcam — measured clean at 30fps (`SUPPORTED_HARDWARE.md`).
USB3 Vision drops frames silently rather than erroring: trust measured
throughput over datasheets, and re-measure if a second concurrent camera
is ever added.

## Camera configuration: who decides what

Neither instrument camera is a Keeler or Haag-Streit camera: both are
generic IDS machine-vision cameras, and Reflex talks to IDS peak directly,
**not** through Keeler's Kinexis. So there is no instrument-maker sensor
configuration to inherit, and IDS's power-on defaults were measured
unusable here (a near-black frame pointed straight at a lamp). See
DECISIONS.md's "Camera configuration: which layer owns what" entry.

| Layer | Owns | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| Keeler / Haag-Streit | the **optics** — light path, image orientation, how much light reaches the sensor at all | can't be configured; compensate in `device_presets.py`, or improve the instrument's own illumination |
| IDS | sensor capability, generic defaults, **IDS peak Cockpit** | defaults are a starting point, not an answer. Cockpit stays the expert tool for sensor-level work (black level, pixel format) — don't reimplement it |
| Developer | the answers, once known | `device_presets.py` for per-model facts; hard constraints belong in the algorithm, not a settings dialog |
| Technician | *this room's* light | `settings.py` → `config.json`, one action per decision |
| Student | nothing | already true — keep it that way |

Rules that follow from this:

- **Push decisions up the table; don't add an "Advanced" tab.** A knob a
  technician can set wrong is worse than a value the app derives. An
  advanced panel is usually a sign a preset hasn't been decided yet.
- **The app holds the values, the camera doesn't.** GenICam cameras
  persist `ExposureTime`/`Gain` across power cycles, so "set it once in
  Cockpit" appears to work — but that is invisible, unversioned state that
  walks off the moment a camera is swapped or reset. `config.json` values
  have provenance and get reapplied in `IdsCamera._open()`.
- **Report what a calibration cost, not just that it succeeded.** A
  technician with no imaging background can judge "30fps, gain 2.6× of
  4.0 max"; nobody can judge "87208.816".
- **Exposure time is a frame-rate budget.** Anything above
  `1/recording.fps` costs frame rate *and* adds motion blur to exactly
  the motion this app exists to record. That is a constraint, not a
  preference — it belongs in code.
- **Check what actually gates a limit before designing around it.** A
  limit that appears in two places at once is worth one query to the
  device before it becomes an assumption — the slit lamp's "11 fps limit"
  and "87.2 ms maximum exposure" were one unset pixel clock.

## Architecture

`BaseCamera` in `camera.py` is the boundary. It owns the capture thread, the
bounded queue, and the latest-frame slot. Subclasses implement only `_open`,
`_close`, `_grab`, and `resolution`.

**Nothing outside a camera module may import or reference the IDS SDK.**
Everything downstream — compositor, encoder, GUI — works against
`BaseCamera` and `Frame`. This is what allows development against
`SyntheticCamera` without hardware attached, and what will make a third
instrument cheap to add.

Frames carry a monotonic timestamp taken at grab time. Never assume frames
arrive at the nominal rate; always use the timestamps.

Cameras are identified by **serial number**, never by device index. Index
order changes across reboots and USB port changes and is the most common way
setups like this silently break. The third-person UVC camera is the one
documented exception — see the Hardware table.

Only one instrument camera runs at a time. The student selects the
instrument before starting; the other one's camera stays stopped, and
switching stops the running instrument camera and starts the new one. The
third-person camera runs for the app's whole lifetime. `kiosk.py`'s
`KioskController` owns this — `select_instrument()` is the only thing that
starts or stops an instrument camera.

`BaseCamera` exposes frames two ways, and consumers must pick the one that
matches what they're doing:

- **`get_latest()`** — peeks the most recent frame without touching the
  queue. For display: `preview.py` polls this every UI tick and is allowed
  to skip frames it never asked for.
- **`read(timeout)`** — pops the next queued frame, so a consumer that
  drains it in order can detect gaps in `Frame.index` and count them as
  drops. For recording: `recorder.py` drains both queues this way precisely
  so `session.json` can report real dropped-frame counts.

Getting these backwards is the likely failure mode if a third consumer gets
added: `get_latest()` in a recorder undercounts drops silently, `read()` in
a UI poll loop can stall the display waiting on a queue.

## Modules

Each module's docstring has the detail; this table is the map and the one
constraint per file a reader would otherwise break. Every `test_<name>.py`
tests `<name>.py` and says how in its own docstring.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `camera.py` | `Frame` and abstract `BaseCamera` (capture thread, bounded queue, latest-frame slot). The per-frame `orientation` (`VALID_ORIENTATIONS`, `apply_orientation()`) is applied in `_run()` before queueing, so every consumer sees the same image. |
| `exposure_calibration.py` | The pure maths (numpy only) behind `IdsCamera.auto_calibrate()`/`auto_white_balance()`: metering modes (`METERING_HIGHLIGHT` for bright-beam-on-black frames), `exposure_budget_us()`, and `next_exposure_gain()`, which prefers exposure up to the budget and the least gain that will do. See DECISIONS.md's 2026-09-08 entries. |
| `device_presets.py` | Per-model quirks a device can't report: `orientation_for_model()` and `pixel_clock_hz_for_model()`. Consulted by `IdsCamera._open()`; a `config.json` `orientation` overrides it. The older BIO's (no-op) orientation is defaulted in `net2860_winusb_camera.py` instead, since it has no IDS model string. Where this is headed: ROADMAP.md's device-profiles entry. |
| `synthetic_camera.py` | `SyntheticCamera` — generated frames with a burned-in counter; `latency`/`drop_rate` knobs exercise failure paths without hardware. |
| `uvc_camera.py` | `UvcCamera` — the third-person webcam via `cv2.VideoCapture`: `device` (a DirectShow index, for Preview) or `vid_pid` (resolved at `start()`, the runtime path). `Frame.index` is self-counted. Reopens itself after ~0.5 s of failed reads, since `cv2.VideoCapture` never recovers on its own. |
| `uvc_enumeration.py` | `list_uvc_devices()` (index/name/VID:PID in `CAP_DSHOW`'s open order, via `pygrabber`) and `resolve_device()` (the single-device fallback and ambiguity rules). |
| `ids_camera.py` | `IdsCamera` — both IDS GenICam cameras, opened by serial; resolves an unset `orientation` from `device_presets` by `ModelName()`. `list_ids_devices()` feeds `settings.py`'s dropdowns. |
| `winusb.py` | ctypes over inbox `winusb.dll`/`setupapi.dll` — no vendor SDK. Discovery by VID/PID, control transfers, alternate settings, `IsochReader`. Knows USB, not frames: `net2860_winusb_camera.py` is its only importer, the same boundary drawn around the IDS SDK. |
| `net2860_winusb_camera.py` | `Net2860WinUsbCamera` — the older BIO's KS722OUP (EM2860 bridge), `kind: "net2860_winusb"`. The host configures only the bridge; the camera board runs its own AE/AWB, so there is no exposure/gain to offer. `Frame.index` is the camera's own field counter, so its gaps are **real** drops. |
| `net2860_init.py` | `START_WRITES`/`STOP_WRITES` — the EM2860 init sequence captured from Keeler's driver and verified by register readback. Split in two because replaying it whole switches the bridge straight back off. Its docstring says how to re-derive it; the capture is gitignored and irreplaceable. |
| `config.py` | `load_config()` reads `config.json` (template: `config.example.json`), raising `ConfigError` before `QApplication` exists. Default paths split on `is_frozen()`: CWD in dev, `%ProgramData%`/`%PUBLIC%\Documents` when frozen (DECISIONS.md's "Frozen-exe installer built"). `exposure_fps_warnings()` reports, never raises. |
| `compositor.py` | Aspect-preserving, letterboxed layouts, and `compose_layout()` — the one place deciding which stream goes where. `viewer.py` and `session_export.py` both render through it, so what a student sees is what they export. Called at watch time, never at record time. |
| `session_format.py` | The on-disk vocabulary of a session (`SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION`, role names, `MANIFEST_NAME`). No imports, so readers don't pull in the writer — which keeps the encoder out of the viewer-only build. |
| `session_export.py` | `export_session()` — one constant-frame-rate MP4 in a chosen layout. Writes a `.partial.mp4` and moves it into place, so a cancelled or failed export leaves nothing that looks finished; never overwrites a stream file. No Qt. |
| `session_reader.py` | `Session.load()` (`format_version: 2` only), `list_sessions()` (newest first, skipping unreadable ones), and `SessionPlayer` — per stream, the last frame at or before media time *t*; alignment is by PTS alone. No Qt. |
| `viewer.py` | `ViewerDialog` (play, scrub, live layout picker, cancellable Export) and `SessionPickerDialog` (with "Open a recording folder…", which a review machine needs). `QDialog`s so `app.py` opens them modally and `main()` runs standalone as `viewer.exe`. Never modifies a recording. Tears down on `finished`, not `closeEvent`: it holds open PyAV decoders. |
| `app_icon.py` | `icon_path()` — `assets/` in a checkout, `sys._MEIPASS/assets` when frozen. Stdlib only, since the tkinter `setup_wizard.py` needs it too; a missing file gives a null `QIcon`, never an exception. |
| `qt_image.py` | `bgr_to_pixmap()` — the one BGR-to-`QPixmap` conversion, shared by every live-feed window. |
| `neco_reflex_theme.py` | Brand palette and fonts — constants only, no imports (a test enforces it); every brand color or font reads from here. The brand spec is the Notion page "NECO Reflex — Branding Decisions", deliberately not restated in this public repo. Banner reds/ambers and the black behind video panes are not brand colors. |
| `reflex_style.py` | `apply()` — Fusion style, palette, font and a stylesheet keyed on object names. Called by `app.main()`/`viewer.main()` only; `settings.py` and `preview.py` stay native. |
| `reflex_mark.py` | `ReflexMark` — the cat-eye mark, the kiosk's recording indicator. The pupil opens from slit to round, shape and color together, so the state survives grayscale. `set_recording()` is idempotent (called every poll tick). No focus, no clicks. |
| `branding/` | The mark's SVG geometry (`test_reflex_mark.py` holds the widget to it) and `build_icons.py`, which writes `assets/*.ico`. Not packaged. |
| `preview.py` | Dev tool: two live cameras, layout dropdown, frame-index/skew readout, via `get_latest()`. Has no Start/Stop discipline. |
| `recorder.py` | Two separate VFR files on one shared clock, no compositing. A `_StreamWriter` per camera drains with `read()`, stamps ms PTS from the session origin, enforces the `recording.fps` ceiling, then remuxes MKV→MP4, verifies, and deletes the MKV. Writes `session.json` v2. See DECISIONS.md's "Recorder/Viewer split" entries. |
| `retention.py` | Opt-in cleanup of old sessions (`config.json`'s `retention`, off by default), once at `app.py` startup: an age sweep plus a low-disk pass. Never touches a non-session folder, a session without `session.json`, or the newest session. |
| `kiosk.py` | `KioskController` — the state machine (idle/ready/recording/error): the `select_instrument()` lifecycle, preflight (liveness, **freshness**, disk space), stall and freeze detection, and the session time limit (`MAX_SESSION_MINUTES` — reaching it is a normal stop, and it's the session length the disk preflight budgets for). Freshness (`_frame_signature()`) catches a camera that delivers frames but has stopped *seeing*. No Qt. |
| `app.py` | The kiosk: a thin PySide6 shell over `KioskController` — the Reflex mark, instrument picker, **Start Recording**, **Stop Recording** (the status line counts up against the session limit), **Watch Last Recording** and **Watch Past Recordings** (modal; `_with_preview_paused()` stops the preview around them while the cameras keep running). Picker and viewer buttons disable while recording. Owns no decisions. |
| `settings.py` | Technician tool: per role a dropdown and Preview (with Auto-Calibrate), then Rescan, a recordings folder, opt-in retention, and Save to `config.json`. No hot reload. A separate program from `app.py`. |
| `setup.ps1`, `setup_wizard.py` | Developer-machine bootstrap (venv, requirements, IDS runtime check), and its tkinter GUI — tkinter because it runs before PySide6 is installed. Not part of any clinic machine's path; see `SETUP.md`. |
| `packaging/*.spec` | PyInstaller specs for the three exes. `viewer.spec`'s `excludes` (`ids_peak`, `ids_peak_ipl`, `pygrabber`, `comtypes`) is an assertion: if the viewer ever reaches camera code, the build fails loudly. See `PACKAGING.md`. |
| `packaging/reflex.iss` | Clinic installer: `app.exe` (Desktop and Start menu), `settings.exe` (Start menu only), the bundled IDS peak installed silently, and the legacy BIO's driver package. No `viewer.exe` — `app.exe` contains the viewer. `AppId` is pinned to `reflex`; changing it orphans existing installs. |
| `packaging/reflex-viewer.iss` | Viewer-only installer (~90 MB): `viewer.exe`, per-user, no admin, Desktop shortcut. Its own `AppId`, so it coexists with a clinic install. See DECISIONS.md's "Recorder/Viewer split, phase 4: two installers". |
| `packaging/net2860_winusb/` | `build_driver_package.ps1` builds and signs the legacy BIO's WinUSB driver package. Re-run it after any change to the INF — a stale catalogue fails only at install time (`PACKAGING.md` step 2b). |
| `tools/` | Standalone hardware diagnostics (IDS and legacy-BIO smoke tests, two-camera bandwidth, third-person stall watch, legacy-BIO identity dump). Each documents itself; nothing imports them. |

Who runs what: students run the frozen `app.exe` (the clinic installer's
Desktop shortcut) and `viewer.exe` (the kiosk's Watch buttons, or the
viewer-only installer) — never point a student at anything else.
`settings.py` is the technician's, following `CALIBRATION.md`; `preview.py`
and `setup.ps1`/`setup_wizard.py` are developer tooling (`SETUP.md`).

## Recording output

Each recording writes to `<sessions_dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>/`
(minute-collision gets a `_2`, `_3`, ... suffix rather than overwriting).
`sessions_dir` defaults to a relative `sessions/` folder in dev/test, or
`%PUBLIC%\Documents\Reflex\sessions` in a frozen install unless a
technician picked somewhere else via `settings.py`'s Browse field (see
`config.py`'s `resolve_default_sessions_dir()`):

- `instrument.mp4`, `third_person.mp4` — one file per camera, at that
  camera's **native resolution**, **variable frame rate**. Nothing is
  composited at record time. Fixed filenames by *role*, so the Viewer and
  Export never have to consult the manifest to find them.
- `session.json` — `format_version: 2`, the manifest the Viewer reads: the
  instrument, the shared clock origin, `duration_s` (so a recordings list
  needn't open a video), and per stream its resolution, frame count,
  dropped frames (gaps in `Frame.index`, not estimated), offsets and
  `verified`. `session_format.py` and `recorder.py` have the full schema.
- `<layout>.mp4` — only if a student used the Viewer's Export. A rendered
  single-file composite, not part of the recording; safe to delete.
- `<role>.mkv` — written live during capture, interruption-safe; exists
  only as the crash-safe copy. Each stream's `stop()` remuxes it (stream
  copy, no re-encode) to `<role>.mp4`, verifies that (first frames must
  actually decode — the dropped-keyframe failure in DECISIONS.md's
  packet-filter entry — and packet count must match), then deletes the
  MKV. A stream that fails verification keeps **both** files and is
  flagged `verified: false`. Never both deleted.

**Synchronization is by timestamp, not by frame pairing.** Every frame's
PTS in every stream is `Frame.timestamp - clock.origin_monotonic`, on a
1/1000 time base. Two frames with equal PTS in different files were
grabbed at the same instant — that is the whole sync story. A slower
camera (the older BIO at 25fps beside a 30fps third-person) simply has
fewer frames spanning the same interval; the Viewer holds its last frame
rather than anything interpolating or duplicating.

Everything under `sessions_dir` (gitignored as `sessions/` in dev) is the
deliverable handed to a student — data, never something to regenerate.

## Environment

- Windows, Python 3.13, venv at `.venv` (activate before running anything;
  `setup.ps1`/`setup_wizard.py` script this — see SETUP.md)
- Dependencies, pinned in `requirements.txt`: numpy, opencv-python, av
  (PyAV), PySide6, pygrabber + comtypes (UVC enumeration via DirectShow).
- IDS peak (drivers and transport layers) is installed separately per
  machine — it includes kernel drivers. The `ids_peak`/`ids_peak_ipl`
  bindings come from PyPI, pinned in a separate `requirements-ids.txt` so
  they match the installed runtime without being required elsewhere.
- Development happens on a machine without cameras attached; use
  `SyntheticCamera` and don't hard-code anything that must be measured.
- The `ids_peak`/`ids_peak_ipl` bindings are compiled, with no readable
  source. `vendor/ids_peak_api.txt` (gitignored, regenerate via
  `inspect`/`dir()`) is the authoritative API reference. Don't invent IDS
  method names or signatures — if something isn't in that dump, say so.

## Conventions

- Values that depend on measurement belong in config, not source — unless
  the device can report them when needed, which beats config. Role
  assignment (serials, labels, the webcam's VID/PID) lives in `config.json`
  (gitignored; `config.example.json` is the template), written by
  `settings.py`, never hand-edited. The recording canvas is device-derived
  (`width`/`height` default to `None`: the sum of both cameras'
  `.resolution`). `recording.fps` stays config, deliberately *not* read
  from the device — datasheet fps is the number not to trust. See
  DECISIONS.md's "Config-driven recording fps, device-derived canvas size".
- Record to MKV during capture, remux to MP4 afterward, then verify the
  MP4 and delete the MKV — never delete both (a failed verification keeps
  the MKV). An interrupted MKV is still playable; an interrupted MP4 is
  lost. When remuxing, filter packets on `packet.size == 0`, not
  `packet.dts is None` — see `DECISIONS.md`.
- For variable-frame-rate output, set **both** `stream.time_base` and
  `stream.codec_context.time_base`. Setting only the stream leaves the
  encoder at 1/fps, silently rescaling ms PTS into 1/fps ticks; DTS goes
  non-monotonic and the failure surfaces only at the MP4 remux. See
  `DECISIONS.md`.
- Prefer dropping frames over blocking a capture thread. A blocked capture
  thread stalls the device.
- "The camera is delivering frames" is not "the camera is working." A
  blocked or switched-off camera can keep a stream alive on a replayed
  image while `Frame.index` climbs. `kiosk.py` compares consecutive
  frames' pixels (`_frame_signature()`) to tell the difference; any new
  liveness check should ask what the camera *sees*.
- When a decision has a non-obvious reason behind it, add an entry to
  `DECISIONS.md` rather than a comment.
- Tests use stdlib `unittest`, not pytest — pytest isn't a project
  dependency. Prefer integration-style tests that spin up real
  `SyntheticCamera` instances and check real decoded output over mocking
  internals; that's what caught the remux bug above.
