"""Records two BaseCamera feeds as two separate variable-frame-rate video
files -- instrument.mp4 and third_person.mp4 -- on one shared clock, plus
a session.json manifest (format_version 2) that the Viewer reads.

No compositing happens here any more. Each frame is encoded at its
camera's native resolution with a presentation timestamp equal to its
grab time minus the session's origin, so a frame at time t in one file
and a frame at time t in the other were captured at the same instant.
That timestamp relationship *is* the synchronization; the Viewer lays the
two out side by side (or however) at watch time. See ROADMAP.md's
"Recorder/Viewer split: design" entry and DECISIONS.md's entry of the
same name for why this replaced the live composite.

Each camera gets its own _StreamWriter with its own thread and encoder,
so a slow encode on one can't starve the other's queue. Writers drain
their camera with read() -- every frame, in order -- which is what lets
dropped_frames reflect real gaps in Frame.index (see CLAUDE.md's
Architecture section on read() vs get_latest()).
