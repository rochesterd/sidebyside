# Camera setup after an install

For the technician setting up a clinic machine, after the installer has
run. Takes about 15 minutes for a two-instrument room. No imaging or
photography knowledge is needed — everything you have to judge is written
on screen in plain numbers.

Do this **at the instruments**, with them switched on and set up the way a
student will actually use them. That is the whole reason this step exists:
the app records what the camera sees, and it can only be set up correctly
against a real view.

You need:

- Every camera plugged in.
- Both instruments powered, with their illumination on.
- Someone (or a practice/model eye) to look at through each instrument.
- The room lit the way it is during a normal session.

What each camera needs:

| Camera | Needs calibrating | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Slit lamp | **Yes** — Auto-Calibrate | It has no automatic exposure of its own. |
| BIO (newer Keeler, digital) | **Yes** — Auto-Calibrate | It has automatic exposure, but it runs the instant a student taps the instrument on the picker — before they've picked up the instrument or switched its light on. Calibrating here replaces that guess with a real measurement. |
| BIO (older Keeler) | No — there is no button | Exposure is handled inside the camera itself, where no software can reach it. Nothing is missing; there is genuinely nothing to set. |
| Third-person (webcam) | No | It sets its own exposure in the first two seconds after the recorder app starts. See step 8. |

## The procedure

### 1. Open Settings

Start menu → **Reflex Settings**. You'll see one row per
camera: **Slit Lamp**, **BIO**, **Third-Person**.

If a row's dropdown is empty or missing a camera, plug it in and press
**Rescan**.

### 2. Fill in each row: device, profile, name

An instrument row has three fields. You choose the first two and type the
third.

| Field | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Device** | Pick the camera that's plugged in. Not sure which physical camera an entry is? Press **Preview** and look. |
| **Profile** | Which instrument this is. Picking the device usually fills this in for you — check that it's right. |
| **Name** | What students see on the button in the recorder. It fills in from the profile ("Slit Lamp", "BIO"); change it if your students call it something else. |

The third-person row has no profile — any webcam works — so it's just the
device.

**Read the line under the row.** It tells you what that instrument needs,
for example that the slit lamp has no automatic exposure of its own. If it
says the profile usually reports a different camera model, you've most
likely got the device or the profile wrong — check both, then carry on if
you're sure; it won't stop you saving.

**If your camera isn't in the profile list,** choose **Custom (unlisted
camera)** and type a name yourself. Everything else works the same; the app
just has nothing pre-set for that model, so check the picture is the right
way up in Preview.

### 3. Set the instrument up for real — before you calibrate

Go to the instrument and:

- Switch its illumination on and set it to the brightness students are
  taught to use.
- Put a subject in front of it and get a normal working view — the beam on
  an eye for the slit lamp, a fundus reflex for the BIO.

**Make a note of that illumination setting, and tell instructors it's the
one to teach.** The calibration you're about to do is matched to it. Wildly
different settings will give students a dark or washed-out recording.

### 4. Preview, and focus

With that view live, press **Preview** on the instrument's row.

- Confirm it's the right camera, and that the picture is the right way up.
- Focus the instrument until the picture is sharp, then **tighten the lens
  focus ring** so it can't drift. There is no autofocus on these cameras.

### 5. Press Auto-Calibrate, then read the line underneath it

The dialog shows a line like:

```
Calibrated.   exposure 12.5ms   |   gain 2.6x of 4.0 max   |   allows ~80fps
```

That line is the whole check. Compare it against this:

| What it says | What to do |
|---|---|
| `allows ~30fps` or higher | Good. Move on. |
| `<-- BELOW the 30fps recording target, and blurs motion. Add light at the instrument.` | **Don't accept it.** Turn the instrument's illumination up, or open its aperture, and press Auto-Calibrate again. If you save this, students get juddery, blurred recordings of exactly the hand movement they're trying to study. |
| `Couldn't reach target brightness automatically` | Use the **Exposure** slider by hand: raise it until the bright part of the picture looks bright but not washed out to white. Keep **Gain** as low as you can — gain adds grain. |

A high gain number (say, above half the "of X max" figure) with plenty of
light available usually means the instrument's illumination is lower than
it needs to be. More light at the instrument always beats more gain.

### 6. Close Preview and repeat for the other instrument

Close the Preview window. Repeat steps 3–5 for the second instrument.

On the older BIO there is no Auto-Calibrate button and no sliders — that's
expected. Just check the picture and the focus, and close.

### 7. Set the recordings folder

Use **Browse...** to point at where recordings should be kept. If old
recordings should be cleaned up automatically, tick **Automatically delete
old recordings** and set the age.

### 8. Save

Press **Save**. Nothing you did in Preview is stored until you do.

Save refuses if the same camera is assigned to two roles, and warns you if
a role is left empty — an empty role means students won't see that
instrument at all.

### 9. Restart the recorder, with the room in its normal state

Close Settings and start the recorder app from its Desktop shortcut.

**Have the room lit normally and the third-person camera aimed at the
student's working position before you launch it.** That camera fixes its
own exposure in the first couple of seconds and then holds it for the whole
session. If the room lighting changes a lot later (blinds opened, lights
switched off), restart the app.

### 10. Do one real test recording

This is the step that actually proves the install:

1. Pick an instrument. The status line should start with **Ready. Press
   Start Recording.**
2. **Glance at both panes before you press Start Recording.** They're live. If the
   instrument pane is black, its illumination is off or turned right down —
   the app won't stop you, and you'd record a black pane. This is the one
   check that's left to the eye, because a black picture is the most
   obvious thing on the screen; worth passing on to instructors as
   something to tell students.
3. Press **Start Recording**, and spend 20–30 seconds doing the real
   skill — hands moving, beam moving.
4. Press **Stop Recording**, then **Watch Last Recording**.
5. Check both panes: right way up, in focus, bright enough to see what the
   hands and the optics are doing, and moving smoothly.

Repeat for the second instrument. If both play back well, the room is
ready.

## If the recorder won't let you press Start Recording

The status line always names the reason. The common ones:

| Status line | What it means |
|---|---|
| "Select an instrument to begin." | Nothing picked yet. |
| "…the picture is frozen — the camera is on but not seeing anything." | The camera is delivering the same image over and over. Unplug and replug it; if it persists, that camera has a fault. |
| "Waiting for: cameras live…" | A camera isn't running. Check it's plugged in, then restart the app. |
| "Waiting for: free disk space…" | Not enough room for a session. Clear space, or turn on automatic deletion in Settings. |

## When to do this again

Re-run the whole procedure whenever:

- A camera is replaced, moved, or refocused.
- An instrument's illumination is serviced, or its bulb is changed.
- The room's lighting is changed substantially.

Settings is a normal, repeatable tool, not a one-time installer — running
it again is always safe. Re-doing a calibration costs a couple of minutes;
a stale one costs students recordings they can't use.
